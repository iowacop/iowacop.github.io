The IOWA Collective are a group of interdisciplinary artists from the Elam School of Fine Arts, Auckland, New Zealand.

We focus our practice on site-specific art, demonstrated through various mediums and disciplines.

In our work as a collective, site-specific means dismantling hierarchies, boundaries between past and present, artist and audience.

This was a social sculpture performance our group did one morning. We found that relationships between people, and the activities that they do in a certain context are the foundations for any kind of collaborative artwork.

By doing aerobics in the studio space for two hours we changed the function of the space. We also made a change to the people who had walked into the Elam first year studios that morning, for better or worse.
